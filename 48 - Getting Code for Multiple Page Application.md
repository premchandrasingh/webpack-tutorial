In the next video we will integrate Express framework into a Multiple Page Application. We will use code from Section 6 as a starting point.
You can get this code from the Github repository[https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial]. Just follow 3 easy steps:

1. First, you need to clone this repository to your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial.git
cd webpack-tutorial
```
2. Then checkout the branch integrating-express-js-into-a-multiple-page-application.

```
git checkout -b integrating-express-js-into-a-multiple-page-application remotes/origin/integrating-express-js-into-a-multiple-page-application
```

3. Finally, don't forget to reinstall project dependencies after switching to the new branch.

```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

At this point you have all the files you need in order to integrate Express framework into a Multiple Page Application.
